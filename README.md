## Storing Shipping Containers

- **Location Selection:**  
  Choose secure, accessible locations such as warehouses, ports, or designated container yards.
- **Security:**  
  Implement surveillance, fencing, and locks to prevent theft or tampering.
- **Organization:**  
  Label containers and maintain an inventory system to track contents and destinations.
- **Maintenance:**  
  Regularly inspect containers for damage, leaks, or pests to protect donations.

## Managing Donations

- **Collection:**  
  Set up donation drives and collection points for goods and monetary contributions.
- **Sorting & Packing:**  
  Sort donations by type (clothing, food, medical supplies, etc.) and pack them securely in containers.
- **Documentation:**  
  Keep detailed records of donated items, donors, and intended recipients.
- **Compliance:**  
  Ensure all shipments comply with customs regulations and international shipping laws.

## Getting Donations to Their Destination

1. **Logistics Planning:**  
   Coordinate with shipping companies and local authorities for transport schedules.
2. **Tracking:**  
   Use tracking systems to monitor containers during transit.
3. **Communication:**  
   Maintain clear communication with recipients to confirm delivery and distribution.
4. **Reporting:**  
   Provide updates to donors and stakeholders on the status and impact of their contributions.

## Farming in High-Cube (HC) Containers

High-cube (HC) shipping containers are ideal for innovative farming solutions, especially in urban or resource-limited environments. Their extra height allows for more growing space and flexibility.

### Climate-Controlled Hydroponics

- **Insulation & Climate Control:**  
  HC containers can be insulated and fitted with HVAC systems to maintain optimal temperature and humidity for plant growth year-round.
- **Hydroponic Systems:**  
  By using hydroponics, plants grow in nutrient-rich water instead of soil, maximizing yield and reducing water usage.
- **Automation:**  
  Sensors and automated systems can monitor and adjust pH, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions.

### Solar-Powered Lighting

- **Energy Efficiency:**  
  Solar panels installed on or near the container provide renewable energy for LED grow lights and climate control systems.
- **Sustainability:**  
  Solar power reduces reliance on grid electricity, making container farms more sustainable and suitable for remote locations.
- **Continuous Production:**  
  With controlled lighting and environment, crops can be grown year-round, regardless of external weather conditions.
